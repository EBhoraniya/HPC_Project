Here we are trying to compare the performance of quick sort and selection sort for various input sizes ranging from 10^1 to 10^6 .
We are trying to make out the point that why quick sort is preferred over selection sort i.e O(nlog(n)) better than O(n^2).

Both the sorting algorithms are implemented serially as well as in parallel with the same data set for a fixed size.The data sets are generated using random assignment of the values of that range in the array.

Graph for time v/s the input size and speed-up is plotted for a fixed number of processor is plotted for both the cases for both parallel and serial is plotted.

Graph for time v/s number of processor is plotted for a fixed input size with number of processor varying from 1 to 12.

Individual plots of all are also shown.This can be helpful to get the insight for a particular sorting algorithm and when to used.
